HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone

This project's focus was the development of a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens data set. The 10M version of the MovieLens data set was used to train and test machine learning algorithms to predict movie recommendations. This data set version of the MovieLens online movie recommendation service contains 10,000,054 ratings and 95,580 tags applied to 10,681 movies by 71,567 users. Users within this data set were selected at random with the only criteria being that users had rated at least 20 movies.
